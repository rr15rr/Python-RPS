# Python-RPS
Python-RPS or Python-Rock, Paper and Scissors Program. 
This is a program based on Python, which acts as a basic Rock, Paper, and Scissors game. 
It is written in Spanish and it works with if and elif, function, and others. 
I hope you like it, any changes you want to add I am open to changing it. Thanks.
